This is a workshop for developers and application operators
new to cloud native concepts who wish to learn the basics of
building and deploying a web application to a container
orchestration platform.

In this workshop you will be presented:

-   The essence of *Cloud Native* in a modern technology
    and practices context

-   Why *Cloud Native* practices are important to you,
    your employers and your customers

You will also:

-   Build a simple blocking web application.

-   Containerize it for running on a container orchestration platform.

-   Deploy the application to a container orchestration platform.

-   Access your application in the public internet as an end-user.

-   Monitor the state of your application on the platform.

This workshop is the first in a series of workshops that explore
cloud-native development and operation practices.

It also provides foundational background if you plan on checking
out the other Tanzu Developer Center Spring, Spring Boot or Kubernetes
content.
