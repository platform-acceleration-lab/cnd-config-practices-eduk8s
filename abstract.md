This is a workshop for developers and application operators
new to cloud native concepts who wish to learn the basics of
handling environmental configuration separately from a web application
codebase using modern orchestration platform tools.

In this workshop you will be presented:

-   The essence of *Externalizing your environmental configuration*.

-   Categories of tools by which you can external environmental
    configuration.

-   The concept of *Configuration Drift*,
    its consequences,
    and how you might avoid it.

You will also:

-   Externalize configuration of a web application using environment
    variables.

-   Use a orchestration platform feature to separate your external
    configuration from your application codebase.

-   Demonstrate deployment of a *Release* including the container image
    and environment configuration.

-   Demonstrate a scenario where configuration drift can occur.

-   Demonstrate how to avoid configuration drift with an orchestration
    platform deployment feature.

This workshop is the second in a series of workshops that explore
cloud-native development and application operations practices.

The workshop also provides foundational background for other Tanzu
Developer Center Spring, Spring Boot or Kubernetes content.
