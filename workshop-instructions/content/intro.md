# Configuring a Cloud Native app

Externalizing configuration properties out of code artifact
is nothing new and has been used by application developers
for many years even before the emergence of the cloud 
in order to abstract away diffrent deployment
requirements.

Cloud native platform impose additional configuration 
challenges to the application developers, however,
due to its highly dynamic nature in which application instances
come and go constantly.

## Learning outcomes

After completing the workshop, you will be able to:

-   Explain configuration requirements of Cloud Native applications
  
-   Explain configuration options available to Cloud Native applications

## Introduction

Review the [Configuration](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15Uzx3TncuujqoLj9xDx1XhhXQJMdT9KGhYxCFQgSGUI/edit#slide=id.g7ea4a9dfdf_0_1813)
slides or the accompanying *Configuration* lecture.

## Disclaimer

**It is beyond the scope of this workshop to teach you Java, Spring,**
**Spring Boot, Kubernetes or product specifics in this workshop.**

But you will be supplied with some basic clues about how the they
relate to the *concepts* discussed in the workshop,
and some separate references if you want to dig into the implementation
details a bit more.
