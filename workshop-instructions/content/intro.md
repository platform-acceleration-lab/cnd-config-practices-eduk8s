Externalizing configuration properties out of code artifact
is nothing new and has been used by application developers
for many years even before the emergence of the cloud
in order to abstract away diffrent deployment
requirements.

Cloud native platform impose additional configuration
challenges to the application developers, however,
due to its highly dynamic nature in which application instances
come and go constantly.

## Learning outcomes

After completing the workshop, you will be able to:

-   Explain configuration requirements of Cloud Native applications

-   Explain configuration options available to Cloud Native applications

-   Explain the concept of *Configuration Drift*,
    why it can be a problem,
    and how to avoid it.

## Introduction

Review the following slides and/or associated lectures:

-   Configuration Dependencies Introduction - Lecture #10 ([Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VyNcZ_UmkEVeVrUALAkXTKYRuZEMwFepQdBct7j-Urk))

-   Configuration Dependencies - Lecture #10a ([Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17mkMH5tD-xX4CZ41iDrYFggiTuM_CIEnnjYWR3Kg8MA))

-   Platform Behaviors and Contraints - Lecture #11 ([Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1skgQGPm2sBQM59bVMYEhh2seMpQd8HNekluYxJoRyMI))

-   Applications, Deployments, Constraints - Lecture #12 ([Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ihTQrSc5Jpv01SOD18C9TAjknha3sVabGr2zZ-k0PMg))

It is important to understand the context and dimensions of change in
a modern cloud native application and its deployment.
