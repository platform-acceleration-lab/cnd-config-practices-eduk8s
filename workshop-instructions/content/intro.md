This is a workshop for developers and application operators
new to cloud native concepts who wish to learn the basics of
handling environmental configuration separately from a web application
codebase using modern orchestration platform tools.

Modern orchestration platforms and Cloud Native applications are highly
dynamic, where application deployment processes come and go frequently.
This imposes additional configuration considerations and challenges to
the application developers and application operators.

This workshop and the accompanying lectures will give you a better
understanding of how to configure your applications.

## Learning outcomes

After completing the workshop, you will be able to:

-   Explain configuration requirements of Cloud Native applications

-   Explain configuration options available to Cloud Native applications

-   Explain the concept of *Configuration Drift*,
    why it can be a problem,
    and how to avoid it.

## Introduction

Review the following slides and/or associated lectures:

-   Configuration Dependencies Introduction - Lecture #10 ([Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VyNcZ_UmkEVeVrUALAkXTKYRuZEMwFepQdBct7j-Urk))

-   Configuration Dependencies - Lecture #10a ([Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17mkMH5tD-xX4CZ41iDrYFggiTuM_CIEnnjYWR3Kg8MA))

-   Platform Behaviors and Contraints - Lecture #11 ([Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1skgQGPm2sBQM59bVMYEhh2seMpQd8HNekluYxJoRyMI))

-   Applications, Deployments, Constraints - Lecture #12 ([Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ihTQrSc5Jpv01SOD18C9TAjknha3sVabGr2zZ-k0PMg))

It is important to understand the context and dimensions of change in
a modern cloud native application and its deployment.
