Now that you have finished all the exercises,
and watched all the accompanying lectures,
you should have a good understanding of the different dimensions of
change your application will be subject to during it life in production.
You should also have a solid understanding of how to separate the
environment configuration from the codebase,
and the major concepts of the application releases and deployments.

There are some topics that we briefly touched on, but did not cover at
depth,
such as:

-   How to accomplish zero downtime during application releases and
    their deployments.

-   Application deployment and their processes lifecycles.

-   How to accommodate growth of the application through scaling

-   How to handle failures

-   How to implement Continuous Integration and Deployment automation
    and practices

-   Monitoring

Watch for these topics in upcoming workshops.

All the best,
and hope to see you later!
